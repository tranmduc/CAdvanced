Instruction on how to run/compile

The majority of the code is stored inside lib/, which has two subfolders:
- /lib/standard: outside library like jrb, jval, stack,...
- /lib/ospf: code for this ospf project

How to compile & run:
1. Change current working directory to this project (C-Lab-Advanced/)
2. Run "make"
3. Run "./lib_tester" (the client)
